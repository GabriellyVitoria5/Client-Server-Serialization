# MultiFormatClientServer

This project implements a client-server application using sockets, where the client sends data in multiple serialization formats (CSV, JSON, XML, YAML, TOML). The server receives, deserializes, and processes the data accordingly. The system demonstrates how different serialization formats can be used to organize and exchange information between a client and a server, showcasing the flexibility and interoperability of data formats in network communication.
